            <h3>My Approach</h3>
            <p>Fascinated by physiotherapy, I strive to help each young patient learn a bit of anatomy and understand how their body works in practice. In my practice, the most important thing is the relationship with the child – it's through this connection that every little one feels safe and open to the therapeutic journey we share together.</p>
